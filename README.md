Summarize Articles in Seconds with AI!

This project is an AI-driven text summarization tool that generates concise, accurate, and meaningful summaries from articles, documents, or any textual content. It leverages Facebook/BART-Large-CNN, a state-of-the-art model for abstractive summarization, ensuring high-quality, human-like summaries.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this system offers a seamless and interactive user experience while efficiently handling text processing through Flask (Python) for AI model inference. Whether you’re a researcher, student, or professional, this tool helps you save time and extract key insights effortlessly!
