# SITNovate
This project is an AI-driven text summarization tool that generates concise summaries of articles or documents using Facebook/BART-Large-CNN. The system is built with a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and uses Python (Flask) for model inference.

 Features

-  Extractive & abstractive summarization
-  Fast and efficient text processing
- User-friendly React-based UI
- API-driven architecture using Express.js
- Database storage with MongoDB
